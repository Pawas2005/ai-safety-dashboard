Design Decisions and Challenges

I used React state management (useState) to handle dynamic incident data (adding new incidents, toggling descriptions).
Filtering and sorting were implemented through simple dropdowns and state updates.
I ensured a responsive layout using Flexbox for clean and adaptable design.
